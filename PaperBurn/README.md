## Paper Burn
Based on the [Paper Burn Shader in Unity](https://gamedevbill.com/paper-burn-shader-in-unity/) tutorial.  The one difference is that the tutorial used the crumple paper as the baseline, but this one uses "mathy noise".  The reason being that my crumple uses a texture that's generated by paid-for software and I can't put it up here for public use.  

The relevant pieces are all in Assets/Shaders.  
* BurnData - mostly calculates radius from burn point
* BurnGradient - math for the multi-color gradient between start of burn and transparent hole.
* BurnVertexDisplacement - vertex manipulation based on distance from burn point & edge.
* CalculateBurnNoise - make the burn shape wavy & rough.
* MathyPaperNoise - unlike the the tutorial, this paper is based on mathy noise instead of the texture-driven crumple. 
* Neighbors - subgraph taken from the Normal Calculation sample projec in this same repo
* NewNormal - subgraph taken from the Normal Calculation sample projec in this same repo
* PaperBurn - the top level shader that gets things done.
